			<p> <strong>Our approach</strong> </p>
		</div>

			<p>Design does not exist in isolation; it is a reflection of the larger society. As society changes, so should design. The best designers iterate their designs rapidly to keep pace with society’s demands.</p>
			<p>This is our belief at Le Monde Zeya... Good design redefines itself, rapidly.</p>
			<p>Our designers create objects that are both beautiful and useful. We believe form does not follow function and function must not be held responsible for a drab form.</p>
			<p>We strive to create organic designs for our clients- designs that will fulfil all their wants and at the same time become a part of culture, not just commerce.</p>
