				<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
				
				<div class="blocks">
					<p>We are a home and lifestyle brand with an edgy New York point of view. Our products are designed in Brooklyn and responsibly manufactured by the world’s best artisans. We make modern Bedding and Bath essentials for a more comfortable home. Our approach is simple: Great design and exquisite craftsmanship are the foundation of every product we build. Second, we manufacture responsibly with top quality materials. And finally, we try our best to offer products at accessible prices.</p>

						<p><strong>Our approach</strong></p>
					</div>
					<p>Design does not exist in isolation; it is a reflection of the larger society. As society changes, so should design. The best designers iterate their designs rapidly to keep pace with society’s demands. This is our belief at Le Monde Zeya... Good design redefines itself, rapidly.</p>
					<p>Our designers create objects that are both beautiful and useful. We believe form does not follow function and function must not be held responsible for a drab form. We strive to create organic designs for our clients- designs that will fulfil all their wants and at the same time become a part of culture, not just commerce.</p> 
					<p>Our home essentials are designed in Venice Beach. We then travel the globe to locate the best mills to make them. By collaborating with expert craftsmen, we’re able to deliver a premium quality product that upholds the high standards and heritage of that region. Our partners’ passion for textiles is demonstrated through their attention to detail.</p>
